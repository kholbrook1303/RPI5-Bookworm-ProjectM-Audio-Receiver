# ProjectM Audio Receiver Installation Guide

## Initial Raspberry Pi Setup
This step assumes you have already imaged your SD card.  If you need help getting Raspberry Pi OS setup refer to: [Install Raspberry Pi OS using Raspberry Pi Imager](https://www.raspberrypi.com/software/)

Make sure the OS is up-to-date before proceeding!
```
sudo apt update
sudo apt upgrade -y
```

<summary><b>Automated Installation</b></summary>

### Install projectM and projectMAR using the new setup script

ProjectMAR installer is comprised of 2 optional installation modes:
- minimal: This will install everything but configure nothing.  This is a more advanced approach.
- optimal: This will set all of the projectMSDL configurations accordingly as well as set you resolution for ProjectMAR.  This is for users that just want it to function out-of-box.

ProjectMAR installer also supports the following optional plugins:
- a2dp: Bluetooth audio
- shairport-sync: Airplay casting support
- plexamp: PlexAmp casting support and web UI for library control (Requires Plex Pass)
- spotifyd: Spotify Connect (Requires premium subscription)

See below for usage instructions and examples.

#### Installer Usage:
```
Usage: install.sh [-m <value>] [-p <value>]
- a     Instructs the installer to setup an autostart entry for projectMAR (Default: false)
- m     Specifies the mode to install.
        The following modes are supported:
        - minimal           Base installtion for ProjectMAR)
        - optimized         Installtion with optimized configuration for ProjectMAR)
- p     Specifies the plugins you want installed (comma seperated list)
        The following plugins are supported:
        - a2dp              Bluetooth audio
        - shairport-sync    Airplay
        - spotifyd          Spotify Connect (Premium Subscription Required)
        - plexamp           Plexamp (Plex Pass Subscription Required)
```

#### Minimal Installation
```
curl -sSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/kholbrook1303/RPI5-Bookworm-ProjectM-Audio-Receiver/main/bin/install.sh | sudo bash -s -- -m minimal
```

#### Optimized Installation with Startup
```
curl -sSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/kholbrook1303/RPI5-Bookworm-ProjectM-Audio-Receiver/main/bin/install.sh | sudo bash -s -- -m optimized -a
```

#### Optimized Installation with Startup and plugins
```
curl -sSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/kholbrook1303/RPI5-Bookworm-ProjectM-Audio-Receiver/main/bin/install.sh | sudo bash -s -- -m optimized -a -p a2dp,shairport-sync,spotifyd,plexamp
```

#### Uninstall
```
curl -sSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/kholbrook1303/RPI5-Bookworm-ProjectM-Audio-Receiver/main/bin/install.sh | sudo bash -s -- -m uninstall
```

<i><b>Note:</b> Once the script has completed the system will be rebooted.  
If you enabled autostart on the installer the system should come up ready to go, otherwise
- Desktop OS: Run the projectMAR.sh shortcut on the desktop or run '/opt/ProjectMAR/env/bin/python3 /opt/ProjectMAR/projectMAR.py' to execute projectMAR.  
- Lite OS: Run '/opt/ProjectMAR/env/bin/python3 /opt/ProjectMAR/projectMAR.py' to execute projectMAR</i>

<summary><b>Setup ProjectM Presets and Textures</b></summary></br>

***Note:** If you ran the automated installation you already have my presets applied.  Proceed if you would like to add or change anything.*

The preset files define the visualizations via pixel shaders and Milkdrop-style equations and parameters.  The projectM library does not ship with any presets or textures so you want to grab them and deploy them.

There are many options available to you for presets and textures.  In the following I have outlined 3 options:

## Configuration

<details>
<summary><b>ProjectMAR Configuration</b></summary>

### Core Configuration
By default, ProjectMAR is set to automatic (/opt/ProjectMAR/conf/projectMAR.conf).  This means that it will handle the audio devices automatically so you do not need to have advanced knowledge of your devices.

If you prefer to define your devices and their feature sets, switch the audio_mode to manual and proceed with device configuration in the following configuration files:
- audio_cards.conf
- audio_sources.conf
- audio_sinks.conf

Plugins are installed if selected by the installer and is also covered in the optional features section, otherwise your free to define plugins in /conf/audio_plugins.conf.  This simply requires an application path and any command line arguments the application requires.

### projectM SDL Configuration
***Note:** If you ran the automated installation you already have the appropriate settings applied.  Only proceed if you would like to apply additional configurations.*


Adjust /opt/ProjectMAR/projectMAR.conf to suit the Raspberry Pi.  Change the following configurations to the below:
```
window.fullscreen = true

# If using a Raspberry Pi 4, ensure this is set to no more than 720x480 and the projectM.fps is set to 30
window.width = 1280
window.height = 720

projectM.presetPath = /opt/ProjectMAR/presets
projectM.texturePath = /opt/ProjectMAR/textures

## This setting is optional
projectM.displayDuration = 60

## This setting is optional
projectM.shuffleEnabled = false

projectM.meshX = 64
projectM.meshY = 32

projectM.transitionDuration = 0

## These settings are optional (When enabled a preset transition will occur on a "hard cut")
projectM.hardCutsEnabled = true
projectM.hardCutDuration = 30
```

</details>

<details>
<summary><b>PulseAudio Configuration</b></summary></br>

To enable higher sample rates in Pulseaudio (Specifically for various DACs) ensure you add the following to Pulseaudio daemon config (/etc/pulse/daemon.conf)
```
resample-method = soxr-vhq
avoid-resampling = true
default-sample-format = s24le
default-sample-rate = 44100
alternate-sample-rate = 48000
```

Either restart or you can run 
```
systemctl --user restart pulseaudio.socket
systemctl --user restart pulseaudio.service

```
</details>

## Optional Features

<details>
<summary><b>Setup A2DP Bluetooth audio </b></summary>

### Get Bluetooth dependencies

Acquire all the necessary dependecies
```
sudo apt-get install pulseaudio-module-bluetooth

```

```
sudo systemctl restart bluetooth
```

```
bluetoothctl power on
bluetoothctl discoverable on

## Composite Video

### Video overscan
If you notice that the composite display is wider that your screen, you can set the kernel parameters to adjust the margins of the screen to fit your display.  To do this edit the /boot/firmware/cmdline.txt and add the following to the end of the first line:
```
sudo nano /boot/firmware/cmdline.txt
```

#### Composite:
```
video=Composite-1:720x576@60,margin_left=10,margin_right=18,margin_top=10,margin_bottom=20
```

#### HDMI with composite video conversion adapter:
```
video=HDMI-A-1:720x576@60,margin_left=10,margin_right=18,margin_top=10,margin_bottom=20
```
***Note:** This is just an example.  Ensure you are specifying the device/resolution you have chosen for your setup.*
