# Raspberry Pi 5 - ProjectM Audio Receiver

## ProjectMAR News:
***Note:** If you are not up-to-date, you may find that there are drastic differences in the configurations.  Please always perform a backup of your existing configuration prior to installing the latest version.*

 - All new native SDL frontend that handles both graphic rendering and PCM audio data forwarding to libprojectM (Initial Release).
   - frontend-sdl-cpp and libPoco are no longer required
   - uinput used to simulate keypresses (when presets stall) is no longer required.  Input events are handled by SDL unless your on Raspberry Pi OS lite, which will then leverage evdev to send keyboard events to SDL event queue.
   - Additional DEL key feature added to not only remove the preset from the playlist but also from the drive
   - All configurations/presets/textures are now moved back to the projectMAR folder (But are configurable)
   - projectM configurations are now located in the primary config /opt/ProjectMAR/conf/ProjectMAR.conf.  default out of the box will be configured for the RPI 5.  The installer will still set the appropriate resolutions for you if using a non-standard setup like RPI 4 and/or composite video.
 - ProjectMAR configuration has been streamlined with some features like screenshots removed.
 - To better suit VDJ needs I have added a condition that will ensure presets switch within their given duration, unless the preset is locked for which it will not enforce preset duration until unlocked.

 *As always, if there is a feature you would like to see or an issue experienced, do not hesitate to reach out.  For any issues please ensure you provide your setup details so that your issue can be reproduced.*

## What is this?
The ProjectM Audio Receiver will enable your Raspberry Pi to project visualizations through HDMI that react to audio provided by an input device of your choosing.  

## But why?
Growing up I used to enjoy using Winamp with the Milkdrop visualizations built by Ryan Geiss.  These visualizations were proprietary on Windows (DirectX), but have since been ported to other operating systems with the help of the [ProjectM](https://github.com/projectM-visualizer/projectm/tree/master) team.  Since the release of the Raspberry Pi 5, there is now adequate processing power to run allot of these visualizations.

Originally the intention was to add a video signal to the Phono input of my Marantz receiver that would react to the rooms surrounding audio.  As it progressed, I figure why not also control the sources/sinks of the Raspberry pi to support various audio input devices (Line in, Mic, Bluetooth, etc...).

## Video Preview
[![ProjectMAR Video 1](https://img.youtube.com/vi/8kj53j3EDec/0.jpg)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8kj53j3EDec)

## Hardware Requirements:

- Raspberry Pi
  - Raspberry Pi 4  **This will only work with a reduced resolution and fps*
  - Raspberry Pi 5
- 5v/5A USB-C Power Supply
- SD Card (I recommend the SanDisk 32GB Extreme PRO microSD)
- Case with active cooling (The following are my recommendations)
    - Hifiberry Steel case for RP5 w/active cooling and w/DAC+ ADC card for analog input/output
    - Argon NEO 5 BRED Case for Raspberry Pi 5 with built-in fan
- HDMI Cable with Micro HDMI adapter or Micro HDMI to HDMI cable
- Input device of your choosing (You can always use built in Bluetooth; just know there is potential for interference with built in card)
    - USB Microphone
    - USB Line in/Aux
    - DAC/ADC

## Software Requirements:
- Raspberry Pi OS Bookworm:
  - Desktop with labwc (I have seen some sporadic issues when booting the desktop environment, however no issues were observed with ProjectMAR)
  - Desktop with Wayland Display
  - Desktop with X11
  - Lite

## Initial Raspberry Pi Setup
This step assumes you have already imaged your SD card.  If you need help getting Raspberry Pi OS setup refer to: [Install Raspberry Pi OS using Raspberry Pi Imager](https://www.raspberrypi.com/software/)

Make sure the OS is up-to-date before proceeding!
```
sudo apt update
sudo apt upgrade -y
```

### Setting your display resolution
Ensure that the resolution is set according to your device/connection.  
- HDMI it is best to run at 1280x720 for optimal performance.  If you are running a Raspberry Pi 4 you should run at 720x578 as the GPU cannot handle higher resolutions.
- Composite video for older displays will need to be set to 720x480 (4:3).  
- HDMI to composite converter for older displays will need to be set at either 720x480 (4:3) or 720x576 (16:9) depending on the displays viewing ratio.

### Dealing with composite video overscan
If you notice that the composite connection is wider that your screen, you can set the kernel parameters to adjust the margins of the screen to fit your display.  To do this edit the /boot/firmware/cmdline.txt and add the following to the end of the first line:
```
sudo nano /boot/firmware/cmdline.txt
```

#### Composite:
```
video=Composite-1:720x576@60,margin_left=10,margin_right=18,margin_top=10,margin_bottom=20
```

#### HDMI with composite video conversion adapter:
```
video=HDMI-A-1:720x576@60,margin_left=10,margin_right=18,margin_top=10,margin_bottom=20
```
***Note:** This is just an example.  Ensure you are specifying the resolution you have chosen for your setup.*

***Note:** If you ran the automated installation you already have my presets applied.  Proceed if you would like to add or change anything.*

The preset files define the visualizations via pixel shaders and Milkdrop-style equations and parameters.  The projectM library does not ship with any presets or textures so you want to grab them and deploy them.

There are many options available to you for presets and textures.  In the following I have outlined 3 options:

<summary><b>ProjectMSDL Configuration</b></summary></br>

***Note:** If you ran the automated installation you already have the appropriate settings applied.  Only proceed if you would like to apply additional configurations.  I have performed testing of this in Desktop with the resolution set higher but with fullscreen exclusive set to 1280x720 however the performance did not improve.  Furthermore when exclusive mode is enabled but not fullscreen, you will get a cursor that can only be removed by hitting escape.  While this also sounds strange, only set the window size resolution.*


Adjust /opt/ProjectMAR/projectMAR.conf to suit the Raspberry Pi.  Change the following configurations to the below:
```
window.fullscreen = true

# If using a Raspberry Pi 4, ensure this is set to no more than 720x480 and the projectM.fps is set to 30
window.width = 1280
window.height = 720

projectM.presetPath = /opt/ProjectMAR/presets
projectM.texturePath = /opt/ProjectMAR/textures

## This setting is optional
projectM.displayDuration = 60

## This setting is optional
projectM.shuffleEnabled = false

projectM.meshX = 64
projectM.meshY = 32

projectM.transitionDuration = 0

## These settings are optional (When enabled a preset transition will occur on a "hard cut")
projectM.hardCutsEnabled = true
projectM.hardCutDuration = 30
```

</details>

<details>
<summary><b>ProjectMAR Configuration</b></summary></br>
  By default, ProjectMAR is set to automatic (/opt/ProjectMAR/conf/projectMAR.conf).  This means that it will handle the audio devices automatically so you do not need to have advanced knowledge of your devices.

  If you prefer to define your devices and their feature sets, switch the audio_mode to manual and proceed with device configuration in the following configuration files:
  - audio_cards.conf
  - audio_sources.conf
  - audio_sinks.conf
  - audio_plugins.conf
</details>

<details>
<summary><b>PulseAudio Configuration</b></summary></br>

To enable higher sample rates in Pulseaudio (Specifically for various DACs) ensure you add the following to Pulseaudio daemon config (/etc/pulse/daemon.conf)
```
resample-method = soxr-vhq
avoid-resampling = true
default-sample-format = s24le
default-sample-rate = 44100
alternate-sample-rate = 48000
```

Either restart or you can run 
```
systemctl --user restart pulseaudio.socket
systemctl --user restart pulseaudio.service

```
